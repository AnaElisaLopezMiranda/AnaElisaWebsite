This lists all the research I have done with professors. Any personal or course-related research is under projects. 

# Completed

**Prompting the Professoriate: A Qualitative Study of Instructor Perspectives on LLMs in Data Science Education (Accepted at HDSR)** 

May 2025 – Aug. 2025

*Supervisor: Prof. Rohan Alexander*

- Conducted qualitative interviews and co-authored a research paper on the use of Large Language Models in data
science for journal publication (under review at Harvard Data Science Review) while working at the Investigative
Journalism Foundation.
- Developed and analyzed simulation studies in Python and R to evaluate survey design, sampling assumptions, and
response bias; visualized results using ggplot2 and Matplotlib.
- Produced reproducible workflows, notebooks, and technical documentation to support transparent and long-term
maintainable research.

**Estimation under Cox Model with Biased Sampling Data** 

May 2025 - Aug. 2025 

*Supervisor: Prof. Omidali Jazi*

- Wrote a research paper comparing Composite Partial Likelihood (CPL) estimation method and Partial Likelihood
(PL) estimation method under length-biased sampling, confirming results by Huang & Jin (2012).
-  Designed and ran 40+ simulation conditions on biased sampling with left truncation and right censoring varying
hazard shape (constant, increasing, U-shaped), censoring schemes (0–40%), and sample sizes (N=200, 400);
evaluated estimator bias, empirical SE, MSE, and CI coverage, and applied methods to the Channing House
dataset.

# In Progress

**Great Expectations: A Qualitative Study of Statistic Students Perspectives on LLMs**

Sept. 2025 – Present

*Supervisor: Prof. Rohan Alexander*

- Contributed to the ethics application and research protocol for a qualitative study on student perspectives toward
LLMs in statistics courses while working at the Investigative Journalism Foundation.
- Conducted literature review on LLM usage, student learning behaviors, and AI-assisted education.
- Developed simulation workflows in R to test survey structure, ranking systems, and data-processing procedures.

**The Effect of Omitted Variable Bias on Empirical Papers** 

Sept. 2025 - Present

*Supervisor: Prof. Roman Zarate*

- Assisted in a project on omitted variable bias in applied econometrics, focusing on how it affects published
empirical results.
- Conducted extensive literature reviews of empirical economics papers and documented key model specifications,
variables, and results.
- Used Stata to replicate published results and began analyses to assess the sensitivity of estimates to alternative
specifications.
