**The Micro-Determinants of Credit Spreads**

The yield that investors require to purchase a firm’s bond is often expressed as the spread over the yield provided by a comparable government bond. Previous research shows
that this yield depends upon macro-determinants and micro-determinants. This paper
assesses the importance of firm specific factors, as proxied by accounting measures, in determining
the spread for its bonds.

**Subverting the Fear of Death: Platonic, Medieval Christian, and Absurdist Criticisms of Transhumanism**

Abstract: This thesis will apply the arguments of Plato, Boethius, and Camus concerning the fear of
death to the issue of transhumanism. The aspect of transhumanism that this paper will be
focusing on is the transhumanist project to eradicate death. This paper will first demonstrate that
transhumanism is rooted in the fear of death. The paper will then demonstrate that this is the
incorrect way to approach death using the arguments and warnings of the philosophers. All three
authors in their respective books agree that humanity should not fear death because it is better to
be happy with one's lot than to strive against fate. I am presenting the view of the three authors
as a corrective to the view of death as seen in transhumanism.
