    "text": "Hello! I am a fourth year student at the University of Toronto Mississauga. I am studying statistics, economics, and computer science. I am a teaching assistant across three programs (math, statistics, and economics) and have course credits across eight different programs (to be fair - three of those did come from AP courses). My research interests at a high level are statistical (statistics!) and computational (computer science!) applications in the social sciences (economics!).\nBeyond my obligatory interests in my programs, I also enjoy architecture, art museums, philosophy, and sewing."
