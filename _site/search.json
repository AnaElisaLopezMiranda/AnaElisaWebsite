    "text": "Hello! I am a fourth year student at the University of Toronto Mississauga. I am studying statistics, economics, and computer science. I am a teaching assistant across three programs (math, statistics, and economics) and have course credits across eight different programs (to be fair - three of those did come from AP courses). My research interests at a high level are statistical (statistics!) and computational (computer science!) applications in the social sciences (economics!).\nBeyond my obligatory interests in my programs, I also enjoy architecture, art museums, philosophy, and sewing."

    "text": "The Micro-Determinants of Credit Spreads\nThe yield that investors require to purchase a firm’s bond is often expressed as the spread over the yield provided by a comparable government bond. Previous research shows that this yield depends upon macro-determinants and micro-determinants. This paper assesses the importance of firm specific factors, as proxied by accounting measures, in determining the spread for its bonds.\nPaper\nSubverting the Fear of Death: Platonic, Medieval Christian, and Absurdist Criticisms of Transhumanism\nAbstract: This thesis will apply the arguments of Plato, Boethius, and Camus concerning the fear of death to the issue of transhumanism. The aspect of transhumanism that this paper will be focusing on is the transhumanist project to eradicate death. This paper will first demonstrate that transhumanism is rooted in the fear of death. The paper will then demonstrate that this is the incorrect way to approach death using the arguments and warnings of the philosophers. All three authors in their respective books agree that humanity should not fear death because it is better to be happy with one’s lot than to strive against fate. I am presenting the view of the three authors as a corrective to the view of death as seen in transhumanism.\nPaper"
